# ThanhNV's dotfiles

* I maintain this repo as *my* dotfiles, but I'm keenly aware people are using it for theirs.

## Highlight features

* Super cool `vim` and `tmux` interfaces, **good for showing off**.
* Install `vim-plug` and plugins automatically when vim is started the first time (incl. [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)).
* Install `tpm` and plugins automatically when tmux is started the first time.
* Keyboard shortcuts remain close to the default, so you dont need any additional cheatsheet.

## Additional stuff which required manual installation
